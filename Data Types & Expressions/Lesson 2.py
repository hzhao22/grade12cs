#Q1

#a) NUM IS 15.0625
# base 10 is 1111 . 0001
# significand is 1110, exponent is 3, sign is 0
# converts to 0.011 1110

#b) NUM IS -7.6875
# base 10 is -0111 . 1011
#significand is 1110, exponent is 2, sign is 1
# converts to 1.010 1110

#c) NUM IS -5.75
# base 10 is 0101 . 1100
#significand is 0111, exponent is 2, sign is 1
# converts to 1.010 0111

#Q2

#a) 0001 1111 - 0 001 1111
# sign is 0, so positive, exponent is 1, significand is 1111
# 1.1111 to  11.1110 so 3.875

#b) 1100 0010 - 1 100 0010
#sign is 1, so negative, exponent is 4, significand is 0010
# 1.0010 to 10010.000 so -18

#Q3

# sign is 1, so negative, exponent is 2, significand is 1110
#1.1110 to 111.10 so its -7.5 and you lose 0.1875
