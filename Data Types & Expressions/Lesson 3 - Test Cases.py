#Q1
# Generate three (3) test case scenarios for the function count_birthday_duplicate(month, day)
# Provided a birthday (Month Day   for example July 20)
#
# Loop to generate random birthday dates until the provided birthday is generated.
# Keep track of how many times it takes to generate the duplicate birthday.
#
# Return the number of times counted.

#Test Case 1 - Accurate count by generating the random birthday once
#result = count_birthday_duplicate(September, 27)
#print(result == 1)

#Test Case 2 - Invalid birthday
#result = count_birthday_duplicate(January, 31)
#print(result == infinite)

#Test Case 3 -
# count = 0
# while 1 != 0:
#     count += 1
#     print(count)
